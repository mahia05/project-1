                <h2>Founding father of Bangladeshi modern art </h2>
                <p><b>Zainul Abedin</b> (29 December 1914 – 28 May 1976), also known as <u>Shilpacharya</u>(Master of
                    Art) was a
                    Bangladeshi painter. He became well known in 1944 through his series of paintings depicting some of
                    the great famines in Bengal during its British colonial period. After the Partition of Indian
                    subcontinent he moved to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). In 1948, he helped to establish the
                    Institute of Arts and Crafts (now Faculty of Fine Arts) at the University of Dhaka.[1] The Indian
                    Express has described him as a legendary Bangladeshi painter and activist.[2] Like many of his
                    contemporaries, his paintings on the Bengal famine of 1943 are viewed as his most characteristic
                    works. His homeland honored him with the title "Shilpacharya" (Bengali: শিল্পাচার্য) "Great teacher
                    of the arts" for his artistic and visionary attributes.[3][4][5] He was the pioneer of the modern
                    art movement that took place in Bangladesh and was rightly considered by Syed Manzoorul Islam as the
                    founding father of Bangladeshi modern arts, soon after Bangladesh earned the status of an
                    independent republic.[6]

                    <b>In September 2024,</b>Abedin's painting Untitled (1970) was sold for US$692,048 at the "Modern &
                    Contemporary South Asian Art" auction, organised by Sotheby's in London.[7] It was the highest price
                    ever paid for a Bangladeshi artwork at auction.[8] Earlier in March, his work Santal Couples (1963)
                    was sold for US$381,000 at Sotheby's, New York.[9] It was painted on canvas with oil colours.[9]
